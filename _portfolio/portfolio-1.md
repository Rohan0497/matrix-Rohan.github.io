I  developed a car parking detection system using the SSD object detection algorithm. I employed k-means clustering for bounding box generation and multi-resolution training. The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Rohan0497/Transfer-Learning-for-Car-Parking-Detection">here</a>. I also wrote a research paper for this project . You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vs5TSFDVofV6P6d14lZAPZDdLo0Ym6A2/view">here</a>
