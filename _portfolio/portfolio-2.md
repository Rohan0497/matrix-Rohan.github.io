I led a project to develop a privacy-preserving text classification model for a blogging platform. Leveraging enhanced data preprocessing, augmentation techniques, and an optimized transformer-based architecture, we achieved accurate detection and removal of personally identifiable information (PII), including credit card numbers, with notable improvements in recall and F1 scores for minority classes. The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Rohan0497/PII_Classification">here</a>.
