In this paper, I reviewed the RISE algorithm, which generates saliency maps for black-box models by randomly masking input images and weighing model predictions, without needing internal model information. It compares RISE with techniques like CAM, Grad-CAM, and LIME, highlighting its motivation and limitations.
