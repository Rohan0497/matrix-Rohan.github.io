The motivation was to review techniques for image super-resolution using deep convolutional neural networks to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. In this paper, I've critically analyzed the key ideas, trends, and advancements in this field since the seminal work by Dong et al., discussing methods like residual learning, multi-scale features, and perceptual losses.
